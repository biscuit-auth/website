# Authorization policies 

## Datalog authorization policies

A Biscuit token could be verified by applications in various languages. To make sure that authorization policies are interpreted the same way everywhere, and to avoid brittle solutions based on custom parsers of text fields, Biscuit specifies an authorization language inspired from [Datalog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Datalog), that must be parsed and executed identically by every implementation.

Logic languages are well suited for authorization policies, because they can represent complex relations between elements (like roles, groups, hierarchies) concisely, and efficiently explore and combine multiple rules.

Biscuit's language loads facts, data that can comes from the token (user id), from the request (file name, read or write access, current date) or the application's internal databases (users, roles, rights).
Then it validates those facts in two ways:
- a check list: each check validates the presence of a fact. If one or more checks fail, the request is denied. Example: `check if time($time), $time < 2022-01-01T00:00:00Z` for an expiration date.
- allow/deny policies: a list of policies that are tried in sequence until one of them matches. If it is an allow policy, the request is accepted, while if it is a deny policy (or none matched), the request is denied. Example: `allow if resource($res), operation($op), right($res, $op)`.

Allow/deny policies can only be defined in the application, while checks can come from the application or the token. This is how token are attenuated, by adding more checks (i.e. more restrictions) to an existing token.

### First code example

<bc-datalog-editor>
<pre><code>
resource("file1.txt");
check if resource($file), $file.ends_with("txt");
allow if true;
</code></pre>
</bc-datalog-editor> 

## Datalog in Biscuit

Please see the [datalog reference page](./Datalog.md) for more info.

### Checks

The first part of the authorization logic comes with checks. They are queries over the Datalog facts. If the query produces something, if the underlying rule generates one or more facts, the check is validated. If the query does not produce anything, the check fails. For a token verification to be successful, all of the checks must succeed.

As an example, we could have a check that tests the presence of a file resource, and verifies that its filename matches a specific pattern, using a string expression:

<bc-datalog-editor>
<pre><code>
check if
  resource($path),
  $path.matches("file[0-9]+.txt")
</code></pre>
</bc-datalog-editor> 

This check matches only if there exists a `resource($path)` fact for which `$path` matches a pattern.

### Allow and deny policies

The validation in Biscuit relies on a list of allow or deny policies that are evaluated after all of the checks have succeeded. Like checks, they are queries that must find a matching set of facts to succeed. If they do not match, we try the next one. If they succeed, an allow policy will make the request validation succeed, while a deny policy will make it fail. If no policy matched, the validation will fail.

Example policies:

<bc-datalog-editor>
<pre><code>
// verifies that we have rights for this request
allow if
  resource($res),
  operation($op),
  right($res, $op);

// otherwise, allow if we're admin
allow if is_admin();
</code></pre>
</bc-datalog-editor> 

### Blocks

A token is made of blocks of data cryptographically verified.

A block can contain:

- `facts`: each block can define new facts
- `rules` each block can define new rules
- `checks` each block can define new checks (queries that need to match in order to make the biscuit valid)

Their order affects execution: rules and checks can only apply to facts created in their own block or previous blocks.

This is how security is guaranteed:

- The first block contains facts representing the basic rights. They are loaded into the Datalog engine, along with the authorizer's facts, rules, checks and policies. They will not execute on the following block data.
- They are all executed and verified in that context.
- For every following block, we load their facts and rules, execute their rules and apply their checks. They can only see facts from previous blocks.

That way, a token cannot increase its rights when adding blocks; the only way they can change execution is by adding checks covering previous blocks.

## Example tokens

Let's make an example from an S3-like application on which we can store and retrieve files, with users having access to "buckets" holding a list of files.

Here is a first example token, that will hold a user id. This token only contains one block, that has been signed with the root private key. The authorizer's side knows the root public key and, upon receiving the request, will deserialize the token and verify its signature, thus authenticating the token.

<bc-token-printer biscuit="En0KEwoEMTIzNBgDIgkKBwgKEgMYgAgSJAgAEiBw-OHV3egI0IVjiC1vdB7WZ__t0FCvB2s-81PexdwuqxpAolMr9XDP7T44qgdXxtumc2P3O93pCHaGSuBUs3_f8nsQJ7NU6PdkujZIMStzEJ36CDnxawSZjUAKoTO-a1cCDSIiCiBPsG53WHcpxeydjSpFYNYnvPAeM1tVBvOEG9SQgMrzbw=="></bc-token-printer>


Here the token carries a single block, `authority`, that is the initial block containing basic rights, which can be refined in subsequent blocks.

Let's assume the user is sending this token with a `PUT /bucket_5678/folder1/hello.txt` HTTP request. The authorizer would then load the token's facts and rules, along with facts from the request:

<bc-datalog-editor>
<pre><code>
user("user_1234");
operation("write");
resource("bucket_5678", "/folder1/hello.txt");
time(2020-11-17T12:00:00+00:00);
</code></pre>
</bc-datalog-editor> 

The authorizer would also be able to load authorization data from its database, like ownership information: `owner("user_1234", "bucket_1234")`, `owner("user_1234", "bucket_5678")` `owner("user_ABCD", "bucket_ABCD")`. In practice, this data could be filtered by limiting it to facts related to the current ressource, or extracting the user id from the token with a query.

The authorizer can also load its own rules, like creating one specifying rights if we own a specific folder:

<bc-datalog-editor>
<pre><code>
// the resource owner has all rights on the resource
right($bucket, $path, $operation) <-
  resource($bucket, $path),
  operation($operation),
  user($id),
  owner($id, $bucket)
</code></pre>
</bc-datalog-editor> 

This rule will generate a `right` fact if it finds data matching the variables.

We end up with a system with the following facts:

<bc-datalog-editor>
<pre><code>
user("user_1234");
operation("write");
resource("bucket_5678", "/folder1/hello.txt");
current_time(2020-11-17T12:00:00+00:00);
owner("user_1234", "bucket_1234");
owner("user_1234", "bucket_5678");
owner("user_ABCD", "bucket_ABCD");
right("bucket_5678", "/folder1/hello.txt", "write");
</code></pre>
</bc-datalog-editor> 

At last, the authorizer provides a policy to test that we have the rights for this operation:

<bc-datalog-editor>
<pre><code>
allow if
  right($bucket, $path, $operation),
  resource($bucket, $path),
  operation($operation);
</code></pre>
</bc-datalog-editor> 

Here we can find matching facts, so the request succeeds. If the request was done on `bucket_ABCD`, we would not be able to generate the `right` fact for it and the request would fail.

Now, what if we wanted to limit access to reading `/folder1/hello.txt` in `bucket_5678`?

We could ask the authorization server to generate a token with only that specific access:

<bc-token-printer biscuit="EqEBCjcKC2J1Y2tldF81Njc4ChIvZm9sZGVyMS9oZWxsby50eHQYAyISChAIBBIDGIAIEgMYgQgSAhgAEiQIABIgCxu0Xjo6dUhbxvvSZWXktNjkYwNVCJdX4Oc0VjbzFMYaQDdAHC244NGJcyhz75EqL56BnrOrquIOS5kW-hMoTVmFP846WGSQEeMhnyWhB6_ibg8HCtlrZ2beihSul3lEnwQiIgogFHWo9rDbhDCZbh3gsUjbn-8rCGhpmukxsphfZKJKoZM="></bc-token-printer>

Without a `user`, the authorizer would be unable to generate more `right` facts and would only have the one provided by the token.

But we could also take the first token, and restrict it by adding a block containing a new check:

<bc-token-printer biscuit="En0KEwoEMTIzNBgDIgkKBwgKEgMYgAgSJAgAEiBw-OHV3egI0IVjiC1vdB7WZ__t0FCvB2s-81PexdwuqxpAolMr9XDP7T44qgdXxtumc2P3O93pCHaGSuBUs3_f8nsQJ7NU6PdkujZIMStzEJ36CDnxawSZjUAKoTO-a1cCDRqrAQpBCgtidWNrZXRfNTY3OAoSL2ZvbGRlcjEvaGVsbG8udHh0GAMyHAoaCgIIGxIMCAISAxiBCBIDGIIIEgYIAxICGAASJAgAEiBl-6CdFUkuctDhcpZv7_xra-IVXuuaC5hBKgOZbPdVoRpAslJIfbaa076hHmML-VhU7t-73iaiHWZu95G7AFFiPEuPIygBlmcxP5MZh_H4wN-TDLdy8JwcRazvajhhwMVNBCIiCiDERGgv9mgdpHxUp16L83cjMLzYQAu9_C5KESRC1dmNSA=="></bc-token-printer>

With that token, if the holder tried to do a `PUT /bucket_5678/folder1/hello.txt` request, we would end up with the following facts:

<bc-datalog-editor>
<pre><code>
user("user_1234");
operation("write");
resource("bucket_5678", "/folder1/hello.txt");
current_time(2020-11-17T12:00:00+00:00);
owner("user_1234", "bucket_1234");
owner("user_1234", "bucket_5678");
owner("user_ABCD", "bucket_ABCD");
right("bucket_5678", "/folder1/hello.txt", "write");
</code></pre>
</bc-datalog-editor> 

The authorizer's policy would still succeed, but the check from block 1 would fail because it cannot find `operation("read")`.

By playing with the facts provided on the token and authorizer sides, generating data through rules, and restricting access with a series of checks, it is possible to build powerful rights management systems, with fine grained controls, in a small, cryptographically secured token.
