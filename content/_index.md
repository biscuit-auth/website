<p>Test authorization policies in Datalog:</p>
<div class="text-left">
{% datalog() %}
// we receive a request to read "admin.doc"
// The request contains a token with the following content
user(1234);

// this restricts the kind of operation to "read"
check if operation("read");

// The authorizer loads facts representing the request
resource("admin.doc");
operation("read");

// The authorizer loads the user's rights
right(1234, "admin.doc", "read");
right(1234, "admin.doc", "write");

// Finally, the authorizer tests policies
// by looking for a set of facts matching them
allow if
  user($user_id),
  resource($res),
  operation($op),
  right($user_id, $res, $op);
